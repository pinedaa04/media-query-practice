Class suggested ideas for how this site could be improved with media queries: 

- nav text starts overlapping (<615px)
- font size is way too small on small device size
- on small devices, too much blank space - less gradient bg needed on smaller sizes
- footer text breaks in weird spots in small widths, form looks funky- could fix by setting minimum font size, maybe reset form to "display: block"
- on small sizes, horizontal scrolling is required to see text around form, when you're trying to fill out form
- at 400px w, submit moves under text field - might be ok, might benefit from break between label & input 
- figcaption text wraps at 350px
